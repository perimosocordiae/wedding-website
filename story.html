      <h1>How We Met: CJ's Story</h1>
      <img class="imgr inspace-5" src="images/cj_beer.png" alt="CJ adjusting to grad school">
      <p>It was my first year of graduate school in Amherst, Massachusetts,
      and I was busy trying to get settled: adjusting to grad student life,
      learning the area, and making lots of new friends. I quickly found that
      the grad student community in Amherst was pretty small, which means that
      you'll probably bump into people without even trying. Never was that more
      apparent than with Angela, when we realized that we happened to be living
      in the same apartment complex, only a few doors away!</p>
      <p>Realizing that I'd been given several chances and <i>still</i> not
      managed to ask her out, I did what any reasonable guy would do&em;
      I invited myself to her ski trip in Killington, Vermont.</p>
      <p>To my surprise (and relief), she was happy to have me along, and that
      snowy day of skiing set in motion a series of dates that led to our
      beautiful relationship. We've come a long way since those cold
      Massachusetts days, and I'm incredibly excited for our future together.</p>

      <h1>How We Met: Angela's Story</h1>
      <img class="imgl inspace-5" src="images/ang_2011.jpg" alt="Angela in 2011">
      <p>I first got introduced to CJ in graduate school by my friends in the
      psychology department. (Shout out to Tessa Lundquist!)
      We didn't meet again until we were both coincidentally at a bar in Amherst.
      I was there with Polymer Science kids having a few drinks after our
      holiday party, and CJ was there with a friend touring all the Amherst bars.
      He asked me to join them and I said yes! At the end of the night,
      CJ and I hopped on the bus to Sunderland and discovered that I lived
      two doors down from him.</p>
      <p>After that, we only spoke once or twice while home for the holidays.
      Back at school, we went on a few ski trips together and I realized I
      started to like him. After those ski trips we started to date,
      then fall in love.</p>
      <p>Since then, we've been on many adventures together throughout the world.
      We faced all the hurdles of graduate school together and all of life's
      ups and downs. We even moved to Texas! I have been forever happy
      since I met CJ and he has made my life a million times better.
      I cannot wait to marry him and spend the rest of my life with my best friend!</p>
